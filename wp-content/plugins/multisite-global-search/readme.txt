Adds the ability to search through blogs into your WordPress Multisite installation. Based on my other plugin WPMU GLobal Search.

== Description ==

Easily search through all blogs into your WordPress Multisite by post title, post content or post author.
Multisite Global Search doesn't work with single WordPress installation and it must be activated for all sites using "network activate" in the Administration Panel.
This plugin is based on my other global search plugin, [WPMU Global Search](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpmu-global-search). It has some new features but if you want to keep using the older version of Wordpress MU, you can install my other plugin.
Currently in the following languages:

* English
* French (fr_FR) by Fabrice Perrinel
* Norwegian Bokmal (nb_NO) by Tore Johnny BraÌŠtveit
* Russian (ru_RU) by Sam Savinov
* Spanish (es_ES)

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an existing one, you can send [gettext .po and .mo files](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress) to me so that I can bundle it into Multisite Global Search.

** Features **

* Multisite Global Search Widget. Show a search form in your sidebar.
* Search across all network blogs or only in your blogs if you are logged.
* Search on pages.
* Administrative choice to perform searches by default on pages.
* Search results are showed in a page which contents the shortcode: `[multisite_search_result]`
* Show excerpted results `[multisite_search_result excerpt="yes"]`
* Entries on every site across your installation appear in search results immediately after publication.
* Receive results from your complete blog network, even sites you do not own or control.
* Customizable style sheet for widget and results page.
* Two different form types, vertical and horizontal.
* Put search form into your code with `Multisite_Global_Search::ms_global_search_vertical_form(your_results_page)` or `Multisite_Global_Search::ms_global_search_horizontal_form(your_results_page)`
* Insert search form in templates using the shortcode: `[multisite_search_form]`. [See the plugin page for more information](http://grial.usal.es/agora/pfcgrial/multisite-search).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If you have any further questions, please submit them.

= Can the search form be used with a shortcode in templates versus the widget? =

Insert search form in templates using the shortcode: `[multisite_search_form]`

= How can show horizontal form using the shortcode? =

Use `type` attribute to select vertical form or horizontal form. For example: `[multisite_search_form type="horizontal"]`
Default attribute value is `vertical`.

= How can change results page URI when you insert search form with the shortcode? =

Use `page` attribute to change results page URI. For example: `[multisite_search_form page="multisite-search"]`. Search results will be showed in http://your_blog_URL/multisite-search.
Default attribute value is `globalsearch`. 

= Can I put search form into PHP files using a function? =

Yes, put this code into your files: `Multisite_Global_Search::ms_global_search_vertical_form(your_results_page)` or `Multisite_Global_Search::ms_global_search_horizontal_form(your_results_page)`

= Get error "check you have create views privilege in your WordPress database. Illegal mix of collations for operation 'UNION'". =

The instruction means that you may not have given the necessary priviledges to your MySQL user. The user needs to be assigned the ability to "create views".

= Limit results to just the title and the excerpt =

Edit results page and place `[multisite_search_result excerpt="yes"]` in the post content area instead of `[multisite_search_result]`

= Set the plugin to always perform searches also in pages =

Check option "Search by default on pages" when you configure Multisite Global Search Widget.

If you use shortcode `[multisite_search_form]` use `search_on_pages` attribute to search by default on pages. For example: `[multisite_search_form search_on_pages="1"]`.
Default attribute value is `0`.
