== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What browsers does this work in? =

Fluency Admin has been tested in the latest versions of Safari, Firefox, Opera and Internet Explorer. Users of Internet Explorer may experience some display "issues" to to each browsers particular css-handling ability.

Internet Explorer 6 is NOT supported. It is an 10 year old browser which has now been superseded twice. Upgrade. Please.
Internet Explorer 7 works with the exception of a few display bugs. Again, it is 5 years old, you really should upgrade.
Internet Explorer 8 works pretty well except for the lack of CSS3.

= Why doesn't my plugin work with Fluency? =

The majority of plugins should work without issue when Fluency is activated, however there are a few that don't for one reason or another. If you come across a plugin that doesn't play nice with Fluency please let me know so that I can address any issues in a future release.

Most common cause of a plugins incompatibility are highly custom admin pages, ie. those that don't follow the standard WordPress admin design. In the majority of these cases its not particularly feasible for me to write a bunch of custom styles just to get them to play nice.

= I'm using a version of WordPress other that 3.1.x and some things look weird, what can I do? =

The obvious suggestion would be for you to upgrade to WordPress 3.1, if you are unable to do this for one reason or another then I would suggest downloading a previous version of Fluency (Fluency 2.3 for WP3.0, Fluency 2.2 for WP2.9 and Fluency 2.1 for WP2.8).

= How do I get support for plugin X to be added to Fluency? =

Leave a comment on my blog or post something in the support forums here on WordPress.org or on my Help site (http://help.deanjrobinson.com/groups/fluency-admin/).

Please note that I will not test be testing commercial paid for plugins or those that require me to signup to some spam laden site just to download and/or use them.
Plugins that do not work with the latest version of WordPress will also not be tested.

= What plugins have been tested with Fluency Admin? =

The following plugins have been tested with Fluency 2.4, any minors issues noted.

It's worth noting that most issues that other plugins have are due to poorly designed/coded admin pages, some of these issues I can 'hack' around with css, but many should be fixed by the author of the plugin in question.

* Acronyms 1.6.2
* Akismet
* Analytics360
* cFormsII 11.1 (not pretty, but functional, the admin pages are too far from the WP standard)

* Subscribe To Comments
* TDO Mini forms 0.13.7
* WordPress Download Monitor
