Glossy allows you to define information tooltips that can be used throughout your site with a simple shortcode. Must also install Tippy for the tooltip.

== Description ==

Glossy provides an easy way to create predefined tooltips for use throughout your site. For example, want to create an information popup for the New York Stock Exchange and include it on several posts? Add a Glossy entry and use a short code (ex: [gs NYSE]) wherever you want the popup, and Glossy will do the rest.

The tooltip is created by the Tippy plugin, so Glossy requires Tippy in order to work.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin into your wp-content/plugins directory
Activate the plugin through the dashboard
Make sure you have <a href="http://croberts.me/tippy-for-wordpress/">Tippy</a> installed and activated
Visit the Glossy settings in the Dashboard sidebar and configure as desired
