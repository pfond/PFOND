This plugin allows you to simply enter in PubMed IDs (PMIDs) and have a references list automatically built at the bottom of your post for you.

== Description ==

This plugin makes citing scientific studies in an *aesthetically pleasing manner* much more easy. 

It allows you to simply enter in PubMed IDs on the composition page and have a references list (very similar to Wikipedia's) automatically built for you. At the moment it only supports PMIDs, but in the future will also support citation via DOI.

= Features =

* Creates an input box on your post composition page where you can input PubMed IDs.
* PubMed IDs are then stored in the database along with your post, and this data is used to create a references block at the bottom of your post.

== Screenshots ==

1. The references block at the bottom of a blog post.
2. The PMID Citation Plus entry field above the update button.
3. A PubMed abstract with the location of the PMID indicated.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the requirements for this plugin? =

A recent version of WordPress. The plugin doesn't do anything too fancy, so it probably runs on older versions too.

= Do you do WordPress consultation work? =

Absolutely! I'm a Zend Certified PHP 5.3 engineer, and can customize or create WordPress plugins and themes. Visit http://www.mdpatrick.com or email me (see support, below) for more details.

= Can I customize what is displayed? =

The plugin uses the css class 'pmidcitationplus' in the div that surrounds the references block. If you would like, you may use this class to then style it by adding code to your *style.css* file of your theme folder.
